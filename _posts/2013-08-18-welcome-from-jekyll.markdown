So I decided to create another blog. I've attempted these many times before, I don't know what is different this time.

This time I think I want to keep a more generic technically blog about the things that I learn through working on my own projects such as [Payly][payly] or through whichever company I am working with at the time, at the moment it is [Clock][clock].

Over the past few weeks, I've been building a few different features for [Payly][payly]. After building these features in, I've decided to take a stand for the next 2 weeks where I will be shipping some piece of work be it bug fixes or new features. But every day I will commit myself to doing something for [Payly][payly].

Tomorrow I'm committing to writing something about integrating with Braintree and what I did for Payly.
